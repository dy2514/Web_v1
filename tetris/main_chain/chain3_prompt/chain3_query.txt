Generate a seat control sequence based on the instruction provided.

**IMPORTANT: You must always return a valid JSON response. Never return empty content.**

The instruction format is:
{"instruction": [INSTRUCTION]}

**Response Requirements:**
1. Always return a JSON object with a "task_sequence" field
2. If no changes are needed, return: {"task_sequence": {"1": "unchanged", "2": "unchanged", "3": "unchanged", "4": "unchanged"}}
3. For seats that need changes, use these functions: disk_rotate(degree), seat_rotate(degree), move_on_rail(target), fold(), unfold()
4. Keep the response simple and direct

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "task_sequence": {
    "1": "unchanged",
    "2": "unchanged", 
    "3": "unchanged",
    "4": "unchanged"
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL: Always provide a response. Never leave the response empty.**
