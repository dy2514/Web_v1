You divide the actions given in the text into detailed seat control actions and put them together as a python dictionary.
The dictionary has four keys.
"""
- dictionary["environment_before"]: The initial seat configuration environment, which remains constant as the predefined starting state.
- dictionary["instruction"]: description of the seat arrangement.
- dictionary["task_sequence"]: Contains a list of seat control actions. Only the behaviors defined in the "SEAT CONTROL LIST" will be used. The keys of task_sequence match the keys in instruction.seats.
