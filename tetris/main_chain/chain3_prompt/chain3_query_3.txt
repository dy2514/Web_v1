Start working. The instruction is as follows:
"""
{"instruction": [INSTRUCTION]}
"""
Follow these rules:
1. Keep track of all items listed in the "seats" section of the "instruction" field. Please ensure that you fill out the "seats" sections for all listed items.
2. Return exactly one structured tool call only (no free text / no code fences).
3. Seats maps must be native JSON objects with outer braces â€” never strings. Keys must be quoted ("1","2",...). Do not stringify nested objects.
4. Your seat control actions must obey the following constraints:
- If "facing" changes from F to R or R to B or B to L or L to F, "degree" is 90
- If "facing" changes from F to B or B to F or R to L or L to R, "degree" is 180
- If "facing" changes from F to L or L to B or B to R or R to F, "degree" is 270
- task_actions should include only seats that change and list the minimal valid sequence (no redundant actions).

**Generate the JSON output listing only the necessary actions, and do so as fast as possible.**
Follow the rules above. Think step by step.
