Necessary and sufficient seat control actions are defined as follows:

"""
"SEAT CONTROL LIST"

#Motion action
- disk_rotate(degree):
  Rotate the floor disk; the rail is embedded through the disk’s center line.
  degree ∈ {90}.
  Effect: toggles rail_axis between "x" and "y"; and rotates facing by +90 (clockwise):
          F→R, R→B, B→L, L→F. position(A/M/C) does not change.

- move_on_rail(target):
  Move the seat along the embedded rail to an absolute stop.
  target ∈ {"A","M","C"}  (A=negative end, M=center, C=positive end).
  Effect: changes only position(A/M/C); rail_axis and facing do not change.

- seat_rotate(degree):
  Rotate the seat body relative to the vehicle.
  degree ∈ {90, 180, 270}.
  Effect: updates facing among {F,R,B,L}; 
          rail_axis and position(A/M/C) do not change.

#State action
- unfold(id):
  Change mode to "chair". Use after all other required moves/rotations to deploy the seat for use.

- fold(id):
  Change mode to "storage" (fully folded, space-saving).
